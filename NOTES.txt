# Wat

* wat. http://jsfiddle.net/svenfuchs/YPeQp

* Where the frack am i supposed to put view/display related helper logic
  when using #each? (e.g. format published_at for each blog post on blog/)

* Oh, uh, now there's `contextBinding`? What's that? How's that different from
  `contentBinding`?

# Handlebars

* Can't {{bind-attr}} be just {{attr}}? Who cares it's "bound" in that context?
  {{#each}} isn't {{#bindEach}} either.

* Why is {{#collection contentBinding="foo"}} not just {{#collection foo}}?
  Also, can {{#collection contentBinding="content"}} be just {{#collection}}?

# Router

* I think `Route#connectOutlets` should be something like `action`, `run`,
  `call` or similar (*if* it's intended to be the main user facing method).

* I didn't expect I'd have to pay attention to the timing of loading records
  (even when they're present locally as fixtures) in `Router#serialize`. Is it
  not possible to make this a bound property? Everything else that I use in
  a handlebar template seems to be capable of being updated late except for
  the url generation?

* The `Route#serialize` method is called with various types objects as the
  second argument, which confused the heck out of me. Depending on what I set
  as a context in `connectOutlet` and then define as a context in the action
  helper (does it need to be quoted or not? what's the namespace and current
  scope there?) I might get a controller or model instance. When I use the
  back/forward button I get a plain object?
